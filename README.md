# ZEP-Statistical-and-Categorical-Learning-with-Explicite-Instruction
ZEP Task for Statistical and Categorical learning with implicit or explicit instruction. Contains auditory identification part and auditory AX discrimination part

Experiment:
        Auditory Identification with Yes-No Response
        Auditory Discrimination task

Description:
        Purpose of this experiment is to measure a participant's ability 
        to learn grammar rules for combining sounds with either implicit
        or explicit instructions. 

        The participant is exposed to a series of grammatically correct
        combinations of sounds if the learning is implicit, or with an
        instruction for how to combine sounds according to the grammar 
        if the learning is explicit.

        In the main task, for each trial two sounds are presented. 
        Participant's task is to jugdge whether a prespecified property is
        present in the stimulus or not. Self-paced. Output: RT, correctness

        The final task measures the participants ability to distinguish between
        the different sounds used in the main task. A participant is presented
        with two sounds and indicates wether the sounds are the same or not.
        Output: correctness
